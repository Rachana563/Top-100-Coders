### About Me

> Myself, C Rachana. I am currently pursuing my B-Tech degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Mar Baselios college of Engineering and Technology. I am a management and marketing enthusiast. I believe myself to be proficient in copywriting and communication.






#### Leadership and Influence: 

I have worked as the CMO of Catalyst IEDC. I also have work experience as a content curator in GDSC MBCET. The two roles mentioned align well with my skillset.

#### Networking: 

I think Top 100 will provide me with an ample amount of networking opportunities.

#### As a Top 100 Member: 

Being a computer science student, it is really important to be a part of such events to stay updated in the field.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem: `required field`

We do have a lot of opportunities in the Tech ecosystem, but a majority of them are left unexplored. I think we can utilise the ecosytem to its highest potential through proper guidance.
